SmashBoyOS
----------

1. Introduction

	SmashBoyOS is a minimalistic operating system for my AtMega32 based handheld wich should provide 
	basic functionalities to easily create games. A partlist and an EAGLE layout of the board will be 
	uploaded soon.

2. SmashBoyOS Simulation Framework for MacOS

	The intention of this framework is to provide a possibility to fully simulate SmashBoyOS 
	under MacOS, so that everyone can develop software for it. All functions implemented in the 
	original SmashBoyOS are reproduced using the SDL library here.
	
Further information coming soon...
